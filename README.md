#### How to configure projects faster

I know how to make use of the following folders
- models
- public
  - css
  - js
  - img
- views
  - pages
  - partials

Need to initialize
- git
- npm
- [eslint](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started)
- [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/)
- dotenv
- maybe browserify and common js

I read that you can configure linting for different areas of the project, so since I have a server and a front-end, I need separate eslint files for those areas.

I have my own CSS reset file I use in conjunction with Normalize.css
- public/css/default.css
